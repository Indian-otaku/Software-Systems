## Generalised shift reduce parser. 

#### This Shift reduce parser program can take in arbitrary grammar plus input string (given the token of variables are represented as id) and does shift reduce parsing on them to check whether the grammar will accept the input string or not. 
#### For example we have given a grammar in the program itself, we can change it depending on the problem at hand.
